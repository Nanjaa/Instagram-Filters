When I left off, I was on "install the sdk" and was trying to get it to work in my app. imported the js file, but there's something wrong with the way i'm doing it. even when the only thing in the file is a console.log, it takes forever to restart. on top of that, i'm trying to only import it in Hello.js, but it appears everywhere. when i do leave the original oauth.io content in there, some pages won't load at all.
